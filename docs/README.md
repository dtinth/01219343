=======================================

Project Presentation Plan

Introduction
------------

* Introduce Group
* Outline
    * Software quality control
    * Code coverage
    * Complexity
    * Other measures
    * Tools


Software Quality Control (Thai)
-------------------------------

* Why do we need software quality control?
* How to control quality?



Code Coverage
-------------

### Explanation (Nut)

* What is code coverage
* Why do we need code coverage
* Types of code coverage (C0, C1, C2, C3)



### Demonstration (ArmSE)

* Write short complex software
* Run test and display code coverage
* What other people say about code coverage?



Cyclomatic Complexity
---------------------

### Definition (Thai)

* No need to test.
* Why do we need to measure Cyclomatic Complexity
* What does the number mean?
* What is the standard number?
* What to do when we have high cyclomatic complexity?



### Demo (Nut and Oak)

* Write short complex code
* Use tool to calculate cyclomatic complexity
* Refactor to reduce cyclomatic complexity



### Calculation (Oak)

* Code &rarr; Graph
* Calculation of cyclomatic complexity



Exercise (ArmSE)
----------------

* Calculate complexity (quiz)
* Give code, and have students refactor (game)
    * Give them initial code with high cyclomatic complexity (and explanation of what it does)
    * Have them reduce the complexity
    * The code must pass all tests!



Other Metrics (Thai)
--------------------

* Lines of Code
    * Not an accurate measurement.
* Test/Code Ratio
    * Analogy â€” Review/Test Ratio (A/FR)
* ABC Metrics
* Similarity and Duplicate Code
* Churn + Complexity
    * Look at version control. Count how many commits



Tools (Nut and Oak)
-------------------

* Code Climate (JavaScript, Ruby)
* SonarQube (Java and 25 more languages)
